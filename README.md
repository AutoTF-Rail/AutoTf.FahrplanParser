# AutoTf.FahrplanParser
Fahrplan Parser in image forms

This repo is obsolete, its code has been moved to the [CentralBridgeOS repository](https://github.com/AutoTF-Rail/AutoTf.CentralBridgeOS)

While this current version works, and could be packed into a package, it's not worth it, as it is only being used in the CentralBridge anyways :)
